My Personal Notes/Guides

I have piles upon piles of notebooks filled with material from the past few years I've been studying Computer Science. Since notebooks do not physically last and tend to get covered by others, this repository will hold my personal self-guides through the many programs and concepts I have learned and wish to continue to have access to as the years come.
