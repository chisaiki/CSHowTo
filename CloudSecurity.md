# Cloud Security

## What is it? 
  Cloud security refers to the set of policies, technologies, controls, and practices designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud computing environments (for example: servers, storage, databases, and software handled over the internet, allowing users to access and manage data remotely without relying on local hardware).
  It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud-based resources, protecting them from cyber threats, data breaches, and unauthorized access.

## Key Aspects:
1. Data Security – how is data stored and handled to protect sensitive information?
2. Identity and Access Management (IAM) – Authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to cloud resources.
3. Network Security – Firewalls, VPNs, and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.
4. Compliance & Regulations – Adhering to industry standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 for data protection.
5. Threat Detection & Response – Continuous monitoring, logging, and AI-driven security analytics to detect and mitigate threats.
6. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity – Backup and recovery solutions to minimize downtime in case of a breach or failure.
7. Security Posture Management – Regular audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and fix security gaps.
