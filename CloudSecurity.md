# Cloud Security

## What is it? 
  Cloud security refers to the set of policies, technologies, controls, and practices designed to protect data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud computing environments (for example: servers, storage, databases, and software handled over the internet, allowing users to access and manage data remotely without relying on local hardware).
  It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud-based resources, protecting them from cyber threats, data breaches, and unauthorized access.
